# Fire-Fighting-Robot
In this project we propose a fire fighting robot that can prevent many fire accidents based on instructions given by user. It has both manual and automatic modes. In recent times, the increasing frequency and intensity of fire-related incidents have highlighted the critical need for advanced and efficient fire-fighting technologies. This project presents the development of a Fire Fighting Robot utilizing a combination of sensors and modules, such as gas sensors, camera module, a Bluetooth module, and thermal sensor, IR sensors, sound sensors. The Fire Fighting robot aims to provide a comprehensive solution for detecting and combating fires in hazardous and inaccessible environments, thereby reducing human intervention and improving overall safety.
